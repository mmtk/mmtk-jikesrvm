/*
 * Provides a way to adjust size limits for the boot image.
 * <p>
 * It would probably a good idea to have a systematic way to
 * set the expected size of the boot image segments, depending
 * on the architecture. We currently don't have that.
 * <p>
 * The approach for the initial version of this class
 * was to adjust the limits that have been in place for a while
 * for the architectures supported at that time:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>64 bit boot images are expected to have a larger data
 *       segment than 32 bit images due to 64 bit pointers.</li>
 *   <li>x64 code is significantly larger than x86 code</li>
 * </ul>
